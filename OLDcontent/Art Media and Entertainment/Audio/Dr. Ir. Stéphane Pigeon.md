### A Short Biography (from https://stephanepigeon.com/biography.php)

Stéphane Pigeon was born in Brussels, Belgium, in December 1970 and received the degree of electrical engineering from the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL) in June 1994, with a specialization in signal processing.

He worked at the Laboratoire de Télécommunications et Télédétection (TELE) of this same university from 1995 till 1999, first studying the relative merits of different scanning formats in the context of the MPEG2 codec optimization - a work carried out in the framework of the HAMLET European project - then working in the field of multimodal biometric person authentication during the course of the M2VTS European project. He finalized a PhD thesis on this last topic in 1999.

Then, Stéphane joined the Royal Military Academy as a part-time researcher, working on various topics such as computer-assisted person identification, data fusion, channel coding and audio processing. His last years were related to speech segmentation and language identification.

In parallel, he worked as a consultant, exclusively for Roland Corporation in the area of the musical instrument market.

His spare time has always been devoted to trying out new ideas. He has been active in the sonic branding business for a couple of years, and released some iOS apps. He designed various audio-related [websites](http://stephanepigeon.com/websites.php).

In 2015, Stéphane resigned from his job at the Belgian Defence. That same year, a restructuration inside Roland Corp. cost Stéphane his exclusive consultant job. Fortunately, one of his websites - myNoise.net - became a hit that same year, reaching the TOP 10,000 most visited websites in the US.

Today, Stéphane devotes most of his time developing myNoise, the premier source of non-distracting noises and music. This project lives off its users donations.

Stéphane still works as a consultant. He is open to collaborations in the field of audio processing. Sound processing for healthcare applications, represents one of his recent favorite topics. And his heart still belongs to the programming of sounds for electronic music instruments.

He is married and has three children.
