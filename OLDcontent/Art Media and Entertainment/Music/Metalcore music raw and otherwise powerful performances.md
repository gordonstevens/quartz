CrownTheEmpire is an American music group from Dallas Texas [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_the_Empire). I originally found them through the famous YouTube algorithm.

Here is an [acoustic video "Wake Me Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQDFXJcOmjo) and the studio version of "[Memories of a Broken Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwFmrjuZJ-I)"

The Amity Affliction [The Weigh Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWTF17JwGSY) and [Chasing Ghosts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2BI3Fww1vA).
