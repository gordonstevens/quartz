Teaching English from Canada over the Internet, or moving to the country to the country to teach.
The industry appears to have a few business models, including training to become a teacher while teaching abroad, getting any qualification then teaching.

Contracts can include accommodations, remuneration (check the currency!), flights, etc.

Countries often looking for teachers are Korea and China (Mainland).

Traditionally, I have considered would I want to live there to vacation there, or move there. Can I learn the lingua franca there so I can function within their society, or would I just teach online to make money and not really care about the local culture and languages.
