## "Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in a toy-like body. It loves hacking digital stuff, such as radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. It's fully open-source and customizable, so you can extend it in whatever way you like."

### Features:
- MicroSD Slot: Flipper Zero supports any FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and exFAT formatted MicroSD cards
- USB-C Power and data
- IR transceiver
- 1-Wire pogo pins
- GPIO 3.3V logic levels, 5V tolerant for input
- Flipper has an integrated multi-band antenna, and a CC1101 chip, making it a powerful transceiver with a range of up to 50 meters. Sub-1GHz. This is the operating range for a wide class of wireless devices and access control systems, such as garage door remotes, boom barriers, IoT sensors and remote keyless systems. Users can expand their Flipper Zero capabilities by installing additional apps to read data from various devices including weather stations.
- CC1101 is a universal transceiver designed for very low-power wireless applications. It supports various types of digital modulations such as 2-FSK, 4-FSK, GFSK and MSK, as well as OOK and flexible ASK shaping. You can perform any digital communication in your applications such as connecting to IoT devices and access control systems.
- 125 kHz RFID: This type of card is widely used in old access control systems around the world. It's pretty dumb, stores only an N-byte ID and has no authentication mechanism, allowing it to be read, cloned and emulated by anyone. A 125 kHz antenna is located on the bottom of Flipper Zero — it can read low-frequency proximity cards and save them to memory to emulate later.  You can also emulate cards by entering their IDs manually.  Moreover, Flipper Zero owners can share card IDs remotely with other Flipper Zero users.
- High-frequency proximity cards: Flipper Zero has a built-in NFC module (13.56 MHz). Along with the 125 kHz RFID module, it turns Flipper Zero into an ultimate RFID device operating in both low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) ranges. The NFC module supports all the major standards. It works pretty much the same as the 125 kHz module, allowing you to interact with NFC-enabled devices — read, write and emulate HF tags.
- Full Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support allows Flipper Zero to act as a peripheral device, allowing you to connect your Flipper Zero to 3rd-party devices and smartphones. Our mobile developers have designed apps for iOS and Android that let you update your Flipper Zero via BLE, remotely control the device, share keys, and manage data on a larger screen.
- 1-Wire keys (Touch Memory), keys like used to be used at LaserQuest; Flipper Zero has a built-in 1-Wire connector to read iButton contact keys. This old technology is still widely used around the world. It uses the 1-Wire protocol that doesn't have any authentication. Flipper can easily read these keys, store IDs in the memory, write IDs to blank keys and emulate the key itself. Flipper Zero has a unique iButton contact pad design — its shape works both as a reader and a probe to connect to iButton sockets.

Notes:
- Canada banned the Flipper Zero in Feb 2024, but some articles seem to suggest the government walked back the law, although articles are sparse.
- In March 2024, [Lock and Code podcast](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/canada-revisits-decision-to-ban-flipper-zero) discusses this, as discussed in the MalwareBytes article.
