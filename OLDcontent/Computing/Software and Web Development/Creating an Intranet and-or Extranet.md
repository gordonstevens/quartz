Creating an extranet can be quite an expensive and time-consuming task. However, to cut corners and over-runs on costs, you can use WordPress, assorted plugins, and web server security routines such as .htaccess and restricting IP access.

### Elegant Themes/Divi crew
Elegant Themes has some [interesting approaches](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-create-an-organizational-intranet-or-extranet-with-wordpress) as well as using [Wiki-based](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wordpress/best-wordpress-wiki-knowledge-base-plugins) plugins.

### WOffice
Tried an install of [WOffice on ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/item/woffice-intranetextranet-wordpress-theme/11671924) and the [WOffice website](https://woffice.io/), which is a WordPress theme, but is hacked up out of other plugins which would TECHNICALLY work, but the demo implementation is not 100% working and the "one-click access" is definitely not it.

They run a good game in the documents, but in practicality, it needs a lot more work. I may try this again from scratch because the demos and screenshots look spectacular, but yeah not build this yet. Also, the annual fee for GPL'd software is a bit over the top for the quality seen here.
