Back what feels a lifetime ago, out in the rural areas of Ontario, Canada, I used to train a novice on how to use the computer, and one day I came over he said look I need you to train me how to edit photos on the computer, because it is getting a lot more expensive and too tedious to edit photos using the old ways. He brought out a boxed set of Microsoft PictureIt! Premium 10, and I absolutely LOVED using it. It was made for novices, but could get so much work done. Sure, other programs have some of the features this did, and it's spiritual successors by Microsoft cannot hold a candle to this software, it's excellent. I truly miss it, and one day I hope an open-source project matches the UI/UX with feature set. Until that time, I feel well endowed to Microsoft over my lifetime, and it does pay off. I wish I could find the full suite as the CD set again (heh not even DVD!)
