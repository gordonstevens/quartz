Abertay University online section **appears to be run by Higher Ed Partners**.
- Asynchronous, 6 Start dates per year, Pay per module, uses Canvas LMS
- Uses Python language (Confirmed in E-mail)
- **Course Structure and Flexibility:** The entire course is asynchronous, catering to those in full-time work. Lectures can be accessed at your convenience, with an expectation to complete each module within an 8-week time slot. The course is designed on a week-by-week basis, featuring discussion boards, email access to module tutors and leaders, a student success team you can call, and access to all facilities available to the general student population.
- **MBA Specializations:** The MBA program offers a major in Business Administration with a minor specialization in Data Analytics. All MBA programs share the same foundational structure. Unfortunately, you can only choose one specialization at the beginning, and multiple specializations are not allowed. This is applicable for the Computer Science Masters and the Engineering Masters as well.
- **Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) or credit transfer**: To grant an RPL, we need clear evidence that the previous knowledge you’ve gained is aligned with the knowledge that you’re supposed to gain at Abertay. The maximum number of modules that can be covered by an RPL at Abertay University is **four, which is equivalent to 60 credits**. No RPL can be claimed for the Project Proposal or Project module.
- **Study plan**: On the online Masters, you will study 11 modules in total and always one module at a time. The duration of each module is fixed at 7 study weeks followed by a 1 week break in between modules. The final module, your dissertation, is a double-credit module that lasts 16 weeks. The order of the modules is therefore already pre-determined (Please note that taking study breaks can affect your module trajectory). If you follow the modules back-to-back without taking a study break, you can graduate within a minimum of 2 years. Twice a year, in August and in December, there are also 2-week breaks between modules (in addition to the 1 week that follows each module). Each module is designed to be 150 hours of study, which equates to 21.50 hours per week.
