City, University of London, I have no idea why there are so many divisions and types of London, UK university, but found their Higher Ed Partners offering.

- Cost is pay-per-module Â£650, 180 credits and start immediately.

This probably says everything:

"Are these degree programmes accredited?
This programme has been developed in accordance with the QAA Subject Benchmark for Computing (2016); however, at present, there is no formal accreditation for these programmes."
