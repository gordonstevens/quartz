The online part of the school appears to be contracted out to Higher Ed Partners and take **weeks** to respond, send a lot of inquiries, some are responded, some are not. This is the cheapest university.

- 6 start times per year
- CHEAP
- Welsh school, however it seems to be run by Higher Ed Partners?
- 10 modules + 1 dissertation

### Information from previous student
Importantly, [xorben on degreeinfo forum](https://www.degreeinfo.com/index.php?threads/wrexham-glyndwr-university-msc-in-computer-science-%C2%A36-000-no-bachelors-required.57313/) discusses information about Wrexham Glyndwr University:

Hi,  
  
I assigned to Glyndwr this year because of this thread. So thanks for the hint ![:)](https://www.degreeinfo.com/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png "Smile    :)")  
  
About the Assignment:  
1. Language  
I am not an English native Speaker, so Glyndwr need some sort of verification. I had a phone call about this. Was ok...  
Since I had a few years with customers with English as corporate language, they wanted me to mention that in my resume. So I didn't need any certification.  
  
2. No Bachelor  
At this moment, I am having ten years of work experience. This seems to be enough to skip the 360CP of a BSc. I do have a german "Facharbeiter" Degree for technical informatics, which could be called something like an Associate Degree + 45CP of a Certificate.  
This means, you have to write a complete resume with all degrees in it.  
  
The Course  
1. Two Years till Degree  
Since I have to work and feed my family, I will not make it in two years. I mentioned this and the answer was, that they do no expect to make it in two years. So here is the road through Master.  
You have to pass 11 Modules. Ten Module has 15CP and the Thesis has 30CP, will take about 18h/Week and the duration will be 8 Weeks for each module. One Module will cost 500 GBP. You have to buy vouchers in there shop. You can Buy one large 6K GBP Voucher for the whole Course or 500 GBP Vouchers Module by module. Every bought Module has one free resit.  
  
And you can pause the course for free for 8 Weeks. As far, as I understood, you can do two pauses in a row max. And there will be a limit for the whole Course. But they did not mentioned that. (And I forgot to ask, shame on me)  
  
2. Class Room  
The Learning Env will be Canvas. There are seminars. But it seems not to be mandatory. AFAIK you do not have to associate with the community. Which is nice for me, because I am sociophobic ;-)

Hi,  
  
I do my work 8pm till 10pm only Mo.-Fr.  
On weekend I only work for my Assignments.  
  
Eg. for the introduction, you do a module for critical writing (writing scientific papers), where you have to do two assignments. First is 1000 Words, second 2000 Words.  
To get an A grade in the second Assignment, you need to have 40 scientific and acurate sources.

Hello again,  
  
I am now in my fourth module. Again: you do only one module at the same time, which will last for 8 weeks.

> [@xorben](https://www.degreeinfo.com/index.php?members/52864/) Can you continue to keep us informed and updated on how your journey throughout this course is going. Especially your more technical courses, this is another course I'm considering. Thanks!

As you wish!  
  
I am currently in my fourth module. You only take one module at a time, which lasts eight weeks. The day, you have to submit your term paper (mostly reports), the next module will start. You can choose between two modules (sometimes only one) for every term.  
  
The help you get from the tutors/teachers are a different topic. They will help you, but sometimes it take them about a week to answer a question. I would not rely on them. Sometimes it is better to use the www oder ask fellow students. On one module I had a very competent and fast teacher.  
  
About the modules....  
Every module is similar. You have a plan for every week, which is rather a recommendation, but you can basicaly study on your own pace.  
There are videos, which are sometimes good and sometimes bad. The most knowledge will you get from a main literature, you HAVE TO buy for the module. The prices are mostly between 20 and 80 Euro.  
  
Eg.:  

- Wallace, M., & Wray, A. (2016). Critical reading and writing for postgraduates. Sage.
- Connolly, T.M. and Begg, C.E. (2014), Database Systems - A Practical Approach to Design Implementation and Management. 6th ed. Harlow: Pearson [Education](http://degreeinfo.elearners.com/gwu.htm).
- Nixon, R. (2018) Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript. 5ed. O’Reilly Media.

  
There are discussions, which are not graded. To will see, that in the first module, there is a lot of participation, later there are sometimes empty threats.  
  
Modules like DB Systems or Webdesign are around 50:50 practical and theoretical work. A module like Risk Management is fully theoretical.  
  
Hope this helps.

Sorry to make a break on this nice vintage (can be seen in two ways) conversation. I am now in my last module, which is the dissertation.  
It has a duration of two modules (sum = 4 Months) and needs to be 6.000 words long + the other stuff.  
You can freely choose the topic, but it must be accepted by a supervisor.  
It should be a topic which fits with you later degree title. E.g. MSc in Computer-Science with Software [Engineering](http://degreeinfo.elearners.com/).  
The module before the dissertation is to write a proposal. At this point you should have an idea, what your later dissertations topic will be.  
  
I am planning to create a larger post, maybe a short video about the whole course later. It is very "special". I am with a group of other students and we are sharing our thoughts periodically. Sometimes it is very funny, sometimes very sad.

Ok, the degree was awarded to me. Seems to work fine.  
  
If you have question, get in touch with me.

Hey, thanks! I took a BSc computer-science course back in 2006 but canceled after about 45 Credits (90 credits in UK). Then I visited a professional school for technical informatics, which lasted two years (maybe it could be compared to an associate degree?). I worked as a Unix Admin/Engineer, DevOps [Engineer](http://degreeinfo.elearners.com/) and Oracle DBA for about 11 years till I started the MSc course.  
  
I am now 41. I started a developer Position last year. Now I am working to extend my skills. Working towards new technology certification.  
  
I had in mind to try a phd in a few years. But a fulltime job ans three kids were enough this two years. I think a part time PhD in UK can last 6 years, doesn't it? This is too much.  
  
Maybe some certificate? Maybe something math physics related.  
  
What do you think?
