Essentially train your brain to the state you want it in, like changing gears on bicycle. Except the bicycle is your brain. Study/Focused state, relax state, sleep state, and everything in-between.

[Wikipedia Article on BWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment) at the base if this is [neural oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation) to help the brain into a desired state. The old saying of "Your Milage May Vary" comes into effect.

Can use multiple avenues, including sound, speech, flickering lights, and tactile sensations to cause neural oscillations.

### BWE/BWE-Like Services and Software

Most audio solutions **require headphones or earbuds!**

[BrainAural](https://brainaural.com/) by [[Dr. Ir.Â StÃ©phane Pigeon]] Free, web-based

[Gnaural](https://gnaural.sourceforge.net/) Open-sourced sound software, been around forever, and is Java. Runs on almost anything which supports Java. Not the greatest, but it is free. Worth a shot. Be sure to download the ready-made presets from the downloads page.

[BWGen](https://www.bwgen.com/) One of the oldest software packages on the market, was quite effective but hasn't been updated since 2005, version 3.1.12. Also grab the extra background sounds, as well as the presets from the "Preset Library" Unfortunately it isn't possible to register the software anymore and if you find a genuine copy you're lucky, scan it with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) first! Also note that this software does may or may not run on modern operating systems. Found the shareware version on [filehippo](https://filehippo.com/download_brainwave-generator/).

[Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/) Best of all options, absolutely works well. Paid service.

[SBaGen](https://uazu.net/sbagen/) Old, but untested.

[BioEra](https://www.bioera.net/index.shtml) Old yet competent, uses devices and shows biofeedback. Has car game built-in. BioEra Pro is expensive (commercial version)! Latest download is September 2021.

Transparent Corporation (Defunct, [web archive copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180224045835/https://transparentcorp.com/)) had three software suites called Neuro-Programmer 3, Mind WorkStation, and Mind Stereo. Unfortunately activation services are long gone. The original developer moved on to work at Brain.fm, which is the spiritual successor to these three software packages. These software packages where beautiful and had some of the best [UI/UX](https://web.archive.org/web/20170709021720/https://www.transparentcorp.com/products/np/images.php) ([Mind Stereo](https://web.archive.org/web/20170706052347/https://www.transparentcorp.com/products/mindstereo/images.php) and [Mind WorkStation](https://web.archive.org/web/20170708043826/https://www.transparentcorp.com/products/mindws/images.php) as well) I have ever seen. While brain.fm is excellent, there is something to be said for having the app to yourself, and I really wish these could have been open-sourced for the good of humanity.
