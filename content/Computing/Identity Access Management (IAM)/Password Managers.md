### Super Tier Password Managers 
[1Password](https://1password.com/) is a newer-style user experience and user interface. Searching is a bit annoying though, as the results are using fuzzy logic and do not bring precise results. Toronto-based company, with offices in London, Ontario, and other places. Also appears in [Github Student Education Pack](https://education.github.com/students) with an unlimited single-seat licence. Works on all platforms. 14-day trial.

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), a US-based company is a bit of an older-looking platform (UI/UX) however, it is quite functional and works exactly the way you expect with precise searching. BitWarden also has a [learning website](https://bitwarden.com/learning/). BitWarden is also opensource. Free tier, paid-tier, and family-tier. Paid plans have access to two-factor authentication ("2FA") functionality.

[Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) has been around a long time but I have never used it myself, although I have seen it used in business. Seems as secure as the other top-tier providers.

[NordPass](https://nordpass.com/) from the makers of the famous NordVPN 

All of the above password managers have browser integrations, used in big and small business alike, have not been publicly hacked, and have some form of hacked-password detection service, and charge a premium for full functionality, except in the case of 1Password which is pay-up or no service. All have a reasonable UI/UX and behave the way one would expect, saves your passwords in their respective clouds, are maintained and monitored. 

### The Do-It-Yourself Tier


### Absolute DO NOT USE Tier Password Managers
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is/was owned by LogMeIn Corporation, which has a massive stake in remote computing for business. LastPass was hacked, their entire source code and all user password-vaults where stolen and sold on the deep web black market. Password vaults are being cracked since the sale of the source code and vaults, so it is highly recommended that all passwords and information contained within existing vaults is changed and a new password management service is used instead. The response to the hacking was handled very, very badly by LastPass, as they tried to downplay the extent of the breach and so on. Moreover, the software UI/UX **and** billing is a pile of hot garbage. *DO NOT USE AND MIGRATE EVERYONE AWAY FROM LASTPASS!*.
