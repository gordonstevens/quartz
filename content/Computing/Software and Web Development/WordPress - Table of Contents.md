Building a table of contents for a webpage helps with SEO/SEM, and helps the author think about contents of the document.

Most use H1 to H6 heading tags to build the table of contents.

In WordPress, use either the built-in [Gutenberg Table of Contents block](https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-a-table-of-content-in-wordpress-posts-and-pages/), or add a plugin.
