Mostly common sense, around the kitchen, don't leave the meat out for too long and wash your hands. These courses are fairly comprehensive, but this is just getting ready for on-the-job training, so go cheap and online to save resources. This is especially true if you're recertifying after 5 years, not a ton of stuff changes.

### Cheap online training
- [SafeCheck Training AKA safecheck1.com](https://www.safecheck1.com/) has a [Food Safety (Food Handler) Certification SafeCheck Advanced including Exam](https://www.safecheck1.com/product/food-handler-cn/) for CAD24.98. Probably the cheapest option around! "Approved across Canada," takes approximately 6 hours. SafeCheck also has a bundle: [The food safety course, WHMIS, Allergen Awareness, Mental Health Awareness](https://www.safecheck1.com/product/food-handler-cn/) for CAD49.98.
- Also for some reason, SafeCheck has a front-website, from [Canadian Food Safety Group for CAD24.95](https://canadianfoodsafety.com/courses/food-handler-certification/). All provinces, appears on the Ontario approved list. 

- Competitor [Food Safety Training.ca](https://www.foodsafetytraining.ca/) has a course for CAD29.95+HST, seems good as well. Claims clients such as McDonald's, Tim Hortons, Subway, Toronto District School Board, Boston Pizza, YMCA, Yum!

### Too expensive online training

- A set of famous course curriculums are [BASICS.fst for CAD55](https://shoptraincan.com/collections/food-handler-courses/products/basics-fst-online-course-with-webcam-exam) and [ADVANCED.fst for CAD119](https://shoptraincan.com/collections/food-handler-courses/products/advanced-fst-online-course-with-webcam-exam)
- [Instacert](https://www.instacert.ca/), CAD49+HST, 30 day access, valid all provinces, on Ontario approved list, but doesn't boast any restauranteurs who use it for their employees, and while it's a clean website, why bother? Straight to the "too expensive" tier! 
- Another set of famous course curriculums are called [FOODSAFE Level 1 and FOODSAFE Level 2](https://www.foodsafe.ca/). FOODSAFE Level 1 is CAD88+HST, and FOODSAFE Level 2 is aimed at management and is CAD115+HST. Valid throughout Canada for 5 years.
- Over-priced Canadian Institute of Food Safety [Food Handler Certification Course](https://www.foodsafety.ca/courses/food-handler-certification-course) is CAD 99.95+HST. However, it is used by all major food brands, and has a proctored exam. Good in all provinces.
- Note: All of the local health units, etcetera are more money for no real good reason, can be found via Google search.
