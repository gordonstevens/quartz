Basically it is easy to learn to be a security guard in Ontario, Canada, and doesn't take a LOT of study, so buy the cheapest and make sure it's online. Private investigator studies are a bit more difficult. But still, buy it on the cheap, maybe in a package deal.

The cheapest I have found is: [The Academy of Investigative Studies](https://www.investigatortraining.ca/) Located in Toronto, but teaches exclusively online.

At the time of writing this, CA$149+HST for Private Investigator training, Security Guard training is CA$89+HST. Get both in a package for CAD220+HST.
