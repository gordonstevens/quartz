Several places sell this training, but the original is [smartserve.ca, CAD45+HST for new, CAD30+HST for renew](https://smartserve.ca/online-training/)

It's training to tell if people are too drunk to serve, and how not to serve alcohol to people not legally allowed to consume alcoholic beverages.

Others are available via Google Search for money but offer no additional value-add.
