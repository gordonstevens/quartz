[Vladimir Scmondenko](https://www.shmondenkovladimir.com) has a popular [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vladimirfitness) where he lifts enormous weights in the gym and makes it look easy, and people are very shocked to see him lift weights even though he doesn't look very powerful in his cleaning outfit. Sells 6-month access to his latest information about working out, meal plans, etc., 49USD/59USD per 6-months on his website, and does the funny videos on his YouTube channel. Self-trained, proper attitude. He used to be really weak looking, now he has a hero-build:

"I was born in a small village and started working out at the age of 14. I never had a trainer, or a proper gym to train in. To work out, I used anything I could possibly get my hands on. All I did was try everything on myself. Training methods, new exercises and training life hacks. My whole life I was my own trainer. Therefore guys, if you want to check out all my experience, my knowledge and learn my secrets, just tap to join my fitness program."
