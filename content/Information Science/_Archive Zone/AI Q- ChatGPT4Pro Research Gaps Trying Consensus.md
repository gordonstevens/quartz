In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPV), research has made considerable strides, yet there are several gaps and challenges that remain to be addressed to further advance the technology. Based on recent literature, here are nine key gaps in research within organic photovoltaics:

1. **Understanding Charge Photogeneration**: Efficient charge photogeneration in the absence of an energetic driving force and its effects need further investigation [(Lowrie et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/photovoltaics-challenges-lowrie/b6f792d82903571daa9e5731e09ebcf5/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
2. **Minimizing Non-Radiative Voltage Losses**: A significant challenge is to reduce non-radiative voltage losses influenced by the energy gap law [(Lowrie et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/photovoltaics-challenges-lowrie/b6f792d82903571daa9e5731e09ebcf5/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
3. **Triplet State Management**: Triplet states, present even in efficient non-fullerene blends, require strategies to manage their loss mechanism and explore their potential in enhancing efficiency [(Lowrie et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/photovoltaics-challenges-lowrie/b6f792d82903571daa9e5731e09ebcf5/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
4. **Simplifying Implementation**: Investigating simpler architectures like single-material photovoltaics or sequentially deposited heterojunctions to replace the standard bulk heterojunction architecture [(Lowrie et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/photovoltaics-challenges-lowrie/b6f792d82903571daa9e5731e09ebcf5/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
5. **Narrow-Band-Gap Material Development**: There's a need to further develop narrow-band-gap donors and acceptors to utilize infrared photons, enhance short-circuit current density, and minimize open-circuit voltage loss [(Cheng & Yang, 2020)](https://consensus.app/papers/narrowing-band-highperformance-organic-photovoltaics-cheng/25fef737d6f658cebaf110b86c6db3de/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
6. **Understanding Degradation Mechanisms**: Investigating the evolution of the energetic landscape upon environmental degradation is crucial for developing strategies to enhance the stability and longevity of OPV devices [(Lami et al., 2019)](https://consensus.app/papers/visualizing-vertical-energetic-landscape-organic-lami/2a4c8faadb4f53b2b5b61b8a47bebfac/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
7. **Processability and Scale-Up**: Addressing the solution processability issue widely concerned in OPVs, including the development of processable materials and techniques for large-area fabrication [(Yang et al., 2023)](https://consensus.app/papers/processability-considerations-nextgeneration-organic-yang/e3caa7a76e275eb98af7146c09874043/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
8. **High-Throughput Screening and Big Data**: Leveraging high-throughput experimental and computational methodologies to accelerate novel material discovery and evaluation, integrating machine learning for material design (Rodríguez‐Martínez et al., 2021).
    
9. **Morphology Optimization**: Systematic control of active layer morphologies, including the development of bicontinuous interpenetrating networks with optimal domain sizes and mixed regions, remains a challenge [(Lee et al., 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/advances-morphology-optimization-organic-photovoltaics-lee/42fb3e098e60553e931b3c84b9f39640/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    

These gaps underscore the complex interplay of materials science, physics, and engineering in advancing organic photovoltaic technology towards higher efficiencies, stability, and practical applications.
