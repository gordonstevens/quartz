**Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**¬†fall under the discipline known as¬†**Geographic Information Science (GIScience)**. This scientific field resides at the intersection of computational science, social science, and natural science.¬†[It delves into the study of geographic information, encompassing how it represents real-world phenomena, how humans perceive the world, and how it can be captured, organized, and analyzed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

In academic contexts, you might encounter the abbreviation¬†**GISc**¬†to refer to this discipline.¬†[It is often considered a subdiscipline within geography, specifically within the branch of technical geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_Information_System)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_Information_System).

[The core of GIScience lies in¬†**Geographical Information Systems (GIS)**, which involve data structures, computational techniques, and tools for capturing, processing, analyzing, and representing geographic information](https://sees.mcmaster.ca/gis/)[3](https://sees.mcmaster.ca/gis/). These systems play a crucial role in understanding spatial patterns and relationships, bridging seemingly unrelated data to provide valuable insights.
