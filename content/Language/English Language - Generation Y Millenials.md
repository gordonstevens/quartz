### Informal Generation Y Terms
#### Netflix and chill
Let's turn on this movie we have no intention of watching and then fool around on the couch.
#### Sorry not sorry
Un-remorseful about something with emphasis.
#### Sipping the tea / Spilling the tea - GenY, GenZ 
Started with a meme of Kermit the Frog sipping tea, which included the caption, "But that's none of my business." It basically means pretending not to notice when something crazy or salacious is happening. When you're spilling the tea, that usually signifies that gossip is being shared, and therefore the tea is a little more difficult to swallow.
#### Woke - GenY, GenZ
A political term of African-American origin that has started being used by other demographics, meaning aware of social issues and injustices, especially racism.
#### Swerve
It means you're in the wrong lane—metaphorically speaking. When somebody requests that you "swerve," they're saying, "You're not welcome here. Get lost, leave us alone, _swerve!"_
#### Salty - GenY, GenZ
Being in a bad or grumpy mood.
#### The struggle is real
if someone says this to you, you're being made fun of. They're saying that the thing you're taking _so_ seriously, that you consider such an egregious tragedy, might not be as bad as you think. The struggle is, in fact, _not_ real, and you should learn to recognize sarcasm.
#### Xennials
Older millennials got tired of being called millennials, so they invented a new name for themselves. If you were born between 1977 and 1983 and don't feel like you belong in either Generation X or millennials, you're an xennial.
#### Thirsty
You're craving something. It could be anything from more Instagram followers or that woman you just spotted across the club. Can also be used in a self-deprecating manner; if you want it so much that you're thirsty, it might be time to calm down.
#### Trolls
Jerks who say nasty things to strangers online. Trolling is the act of provoking, manipulating or annoying someone by posting offensive comments online. This is often done for the troll’s entertainment or to achieve a specific goal, such as interfering with a rival’s online activity or deliberately upsetting or hurting other people.
#### Basic
Unoriginal, typical, or mainstream. "Every October, I start drinking a pumpkin spice latte every morning. I’m basic and proud."
#### Goals AF
It's a shorthand for "Whatever we are discussing includes things I've like to achieve or possess in my life." It could be a sweet new tech gadget, or a beautiful woman you'd love to see on your arm. The AF (an acronym means "As F-word") just supplies emphasis.
#### Bae
Before Anyone Else. Likely started as an attempt to say "baby" or "babe" but then they realized mid-way through the word that they just didn't have the energy for that last vowel.
#### Bounce
It's when you have to leave someplace quickly.
#### On fleek
Another way of saying something is "on point."
#### RT
Retweet, a reference to sharing someone else's tweet on Twitter. Shorthand for "I don't have the time or energy to come up with an original thought, so here's what somebody else said." Or, simply: "ditto."
#### Clap back
When you get dissed and you're not just going to sit there and stew in your own juices, you return the favor with a clap back. Get it? You "clap" them back.
#### Fire
Used as an adjective to indicate high quality or desirability.
#### LB/FB
Shorthand for "like back" or "follow back." It refers to the moment when someone liked or followed you on social media and you returned the favor by hitting the same button on your own screen.
#### Hunty
Borrowed from drag queens, calling somebody "hunty" is announcing that you're well aware of their shenanigans, just in case they think they're pulling a fast one on you. "Nice try, Hunty."
#### Quiche
It means hotter than hot. And if there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that quiches are sexy. Wait, what? Okay, maybe not. But maybe that's why this millennial slang works. It's like saying, "She's so hot, she's like my grandma's slippers," or "Her bikini photos are like a kale smoothie." It works because it really, really doesn't.
#### Sus - GenY, GenZ
Suspect, shady, or suspicious.
#### Ratchet
When it's all gone to hell - your hair, your clothes, your job, your life - then you're ratchet. The word was created to describe a woman who can't keep it together, but it's evolved to embody pretty much anybody whose personal or professional life has gone off the rails.
#### Cancel
A less abrasive way of saying, no, this isn't going to happen.
#### I can't even
You can't even what? It doesn't matter. It could be something specific, it could be reality in general. The point is, the world has gone insane, and we _can't even_.
#### FOMO / JOMO
Fear Of Missing Out on something like an event or purchase. Variant of this is JOMO, Joy Of Missing Out.
#### FOBO

#### FOJI
Fear of joining in; the fear that one will get entangled in joyless social activities, meaningless conversations or empty selfie-posing.

#### Lit
Something is especially excellent, such as a lit party.
#### Merica / 'Merica
Poking fun at America's seemingly endless capacity for self-love. When people get too excited about fireworks and firearms and monster trucks, that's ‘Merica.
#### Break the Internet
With so much noise online, creating something that causes a genuine buzz and actually dominates the global conversation, when you're not a Kardashian or a Trump, is nothing short of a miracle.
#### Humble brag
A humblebrag is a modest comment that’s actually meant to invite praise. Humblebragging means making casual or self-deprecating comments about yourself in order to appear humble, but in actuality, you're drawing attention to your positive qualities or achievements.
- “I think my biggest weakness is that I’m too much of a perfectionist. If I’m going to do something, I can’t rest until it’s 100% flawless, which is really stressful.”
- “I feel like I was so unproductive this weekend. I mean, I cleaned my whole house, did all my laundry, and started on this big project with my husband in our yard, but those are all typical weekend chores.”
- “I was not super impressive in high school. I had a 4.0 GPA and was in the National Honors Society and stuff, but I didn’t do very many extracurriculars.”
#### Turn Up / Turnt Up / Turned Up
Other ways of saying you're having fun at the party.
#### Bye Felicia
If someone is leaving and you really don't care, you dismiss them with "Bye, Felicia." It's a diss that really only works if the person you're trying to insult isn't named Felicia. If she is, well, then you've been accidentally polite.
#### Pics or it didn't happen
A form of sarcasm that evolved out of an actual necessity. People tend to lie on social media. Well, they lie everywhere, but especially on the Internet, where everybody seems to crave attention from strangers, and they'll write just about anything to get it. It's hard to trust anybody anymore, so demanding "pics or it didn't happen" isn't so much a request for photographic evidence. It's just saying, "Based on my experience on the Internet, I'm biased against believing you."
#### FOH
When you want to say you're getting the "eff outta here," but are too polite to put it in so many words, the millennial acronym FOH does the job for you.
#### Said no one ever
Four words that can negate just about any statement, with just the right amount of sneering sarcasm. "I sure love family picnics…. _said no one ever."_
#### Because duh
Exclamation points are so needy. If you really want to express how something you've just said IS SO TOTALLY TRUE, just end it with the quantifier "because duh." It works every time.
#### Slay
To "slay" means to do an exemplary job.
#### YAAAAAS
Emphasised "Yes."

All the mundus that grownups do.
#### Extra
Over-the-top or extravagant. Being or doing more than expected for no reason, dramatic, excessive.

Examples:
- “I was so shook when I heard they broke up. I totally thought they were going to be together forever!”
- “That movie had me so shook. The ending twist was so insane—I literally couldn’t speak!”
- “When I won the award I was completely shook. I definitely thought it was going to be one of my coworkers, but I’m so thankful it was me.”
#### Glow-Up
An impressive makeover or personal transformation. "He used to be a bit of a jerk, but he’s had a huge glow up recently. He’s super kind and mature now, and I think he’d make a great boyfriend."
#### Throw shade
**Throwing shade means subtly insulting someone.** If someone throws shade at you, they’re trash talking or disrespecting you, but in an understated or unassuming way. The phrase originally gained popularity in Black and Latino LGBTQ ballroom culture, and it can be found in iconic media such as _RuPaul’s Drag Race_ and the documentary _Paris is Burning_.
- “Her tweets didn’t directly name me, but anyone who knows the two of us would be able to tell she was throwing shade at me. I wish she would just talk to me directly so we can work this out.”
- “I couldn’t risk confronting him directly about his ridiculous behavior, but I did spend all afternoon throwing shade at him and giving him annoyed looks.”

#### Vibe
A “vibe” is the mood or energy that something gives off. It can be used in a positive context (“Oh my gosh, this café is such a vibe. I love the decor!”) or a negative context (“I don’t know him that well, but he has a bad vibe. I don’t trust him.”) There are several variations of this term, including “It’s a vibe,” which means that something is cool or fun, and “vibe with,” which means that you enjoy someone's company.
“There was a great vibe at the party this weekend. Everyone had such a good time!”
“Your outfit is such a vibe. You look amazing!”
“I really vibe with him! We had a great date this weekend, and I definitely think I’ll see him again.”
#### Slaps
If something slaps, it’s amazing or excellent. Like "fire," this term is often used to praise yummy food and great music. "This pizza slaps. I was so hungry, and I’m literally in heaven right now." Or, "Turn up the speaker! This song slaps so hard. It’s my go-to when I want to put myself in a good mood."

#### Receipts
Having receipts of something means you have proof or evidence. People often use this term to call someone out for lying about something. For example: "Don’t even try to say that you weren’t cheating. I have receipts—my friends saw you at the party and texted me pictures."
"I promise, I told you that the appointment was at 11:00, not 1:00. Let me pull up my texts and show you the receipts."

This person has unfortunately "ghosted" you.
"After my interview, that company completely ghosted me. They never gave me feedback, and they won’t answer my emails!"
"Me and my ex friend were supposed to meet up for coffee, but I think she’s ghosting me. She hasn’t replied to my last few texts about scheduling a time."
