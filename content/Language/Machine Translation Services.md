Machine translation has improved a lot over time, especially with AI methods.

Here is a list:
[Youdao](https://fanyi.youdao.com/#/) Amazingly good for Chinese <-> English. This was an Android app at one point. Seems web-based. Noting the desktop version. Website registered with ICP. By Netease.
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.ca/) Yep this one translates to a lot of popular languages.
[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) Microsoft's translator, seems good. Has Android and iOS apps.
[Quillbot](https://quillbot.com/translate) The website known for rephrasing and writing papers, has a translator. Includes a good number of languages.
[Papago by Naver](https://papago.naver.com/) High quality translation, supports Vietnamese, Korean, "Chinese", and Thai, +more. Free, 3000 character limit.
[Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/en/?source_lang=en&target_lang=ru) Excellent for translating into Russian language and Russian language families. Has some rare languages too, including Yakut.
[translate.com](https://www.translate.com/machine-translation) Seems okay, has Zapier and Zendesk integrations
[Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/translate/) Quite a few languages. 1000 character limit is annoying.
[Reverso](https://www.reverso.net/text-translation) Uses Neural Machine Translation (ok whatever) to translate to a more natural sounding language translation. Available on web, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and plugins for Chrome and Firefox. It was expensive, seemed to translate okay. 26 languages, [prem](https://documents.reverso.net/Pricing.aspx?origin=5&lang=en) is 4.21 EUR/month annual purchase as 50.62 EUR or month-to-month as 6.49 EUR on sale. 
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) Seems good but [pricing](https://www.deepl.com/pro?cta=header-prices) is also expensive
