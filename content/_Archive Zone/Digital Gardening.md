### Looking for method of curating notes and thoughts digitally.

Found https://www.vegantechnomad.com/ and has a notion template that organises thoughts and processes somewhat effectively, but it was 20USD for the template, and I didn't feel Notion is a great service as they sell user data and information: https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/sjtlf8/more_people_should_pay_attention_to_the_privacy/

I considered making a WordPress site with my already created site using the "Adaptive Colors" template from liquid-themes called Hub https://themeforest.net/item/hub-html-responsive-multipurpose-template/46765901 (12USD/site) and they also have a WordPress theme (59USD/site) https://themeforest.net/item/hub-responsive-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/31569152 however, the editing and publishing is too rigid perhaps for what I want to do. This is a second-tier solution. Liquid-themes also produces AI Hub WordPress Theme (39USD/site): https://themeforest.net/item/ai-hub-startup-technology-wordpress-theme/47473638

Yet again went to Obsidian because people are crazy about it in the tech world. Was never really a fan of markdown because the base language forgot about needed document tools but it is extended.

Viewed Obsidian website and found Obsidian Sync and Obsidian Publish. Sync is for saving notes to the Obsidian cloud, and Obsidian Publish is for publishing notes.

Obsidian Sync is free for personal use, and commercial use is 50USD/Year. Not overbearing price. Good utility to sync between mobile apps and desktop app.

Obsidian Publish turns it into a website like a "digital garden" however it is 8USD/month and wow that's not a good deal, especially with the size restriction, so when you like to use images, it cuts through like a knife. An example offered on https://obsidian.md/publish is https://publish.obsidian.md/myquantumwell

#### Google searched for Obsidian Publish alternatives, and found the following:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/u7r2a5/a_free_open_source_obsidian_publish_alternative/
-> Quartz: https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz and https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/
"quartz v4 is a complete rewrite in ReactJS based on difficulties with Hugo as backend. Curious how they overlap."
Found https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Obsidian-compatibility and is mostly compatible with Obsidian. Also found OxHugo compatibility: "[org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) is a plain-text personal knowledge management system for [emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs). [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) is org exporter backend that exports `org-mode` files to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) compatible Markdown.

Because the Markdown generated by ox-hugo is not pure Markdown but Hugo specific, we need to transform it to fit into Quartz. This is done by the [OxHugoFlavoredMarkdown](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/plugins/OxHugoFlavoredMarkdown)  plugin. Even though this plugin was written with `ox-hugo` in mind, it should work for any Hugo specific Markdown."
-> Found FlowerShow https://flowershow.app/ "Flowershow is an open-source tool for easily converting your markdown files into an elegant website. It's built on a standard, modern web stack React, Next.js, and Tailwind and shipped with a basic default theme to get you started with just a few clicks." Also available as an Obsidian plugin. Flowershow cloud is 5USD/month.
-> MindStone https://mindstone.tuancao.me/ a free and open-source alternative to Obsidian Publish, and is buggy and has to redraw the tree on each usage. Github: https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden
-> Publishkit https://publishkit.dev/ looks nice and has a plugin for Obsidian: https://github.com/publishkit/obsidian

Self-hosted question: "Can Obsidian Publish be used for a private, self-hosted site? What are the "contribute" features of Publish?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10nwnri/can_obsidian_publish_be_used_for_a_private/ Short answer: Cannot be self-hosted.

#### On Reddit: "I built a free alternative to Obsidian Publish (no programming knowledge required)"
https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10a3421/i_built_a_free_alternative_to_obsidian_publish_no/

[Maggie Appleton's repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) of digital gardens and gardening resources could be of help. There are some extensions to static site generators that might do the trick.

To others' points, once the thing is built you can use GitHub Pages or anything else that serves static sites.

Website is organised as:
The Garden >
- Essays: "Opinionated, longform narrative writing with an agenda."
- Notes: "Loose, unopinionated notes on things I don’t entirely understand yet."
- Pattern Catalogue: "A catalogue of design patterns gathered from my own observations and research."
- Library: "Books I’ve read that significantly influenced how I see the world."
- Antilibrary: "Books I like the idea of having read."
Now: "A sporadically updated log of what I'm reading, exploring, and thinking about"
About: "Designer, anthropologist, and mediocre developer."
Colophon: "A _colophon_ is a nobby designer word for 'how this site was made'"


Typography:

"Headers are set in [Canela Display](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela/canela_deck)  and body copy is set in  [Canela Text](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela/canela_text) , both from  [Commercial Type](https://commercialtype.com/). I love its semi-serifs and classical feel. Supporting sans-serif type is set in  [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). I use a [fluid type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales) developed by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), which uses some wild CSS calculations to continuously adjust the font size relative to your browser's width."




--> Pure awesome, is exactly what I want.

### Writing and Editing Content

My CMS is just a bunch of flat files and folders. When I edit content on here I'm just typing text and syntax into MDX and JS files in VS Code. There's no fancy pipeline shuttling content directly from my personal knowledge management database (eg. [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) or [Tana](https://tana.inc/)). All my ideas start and marinate in my Tana, but I wait for them to mature a bit before they move over to this garden.

I know other people prefer setups where they can click one button and push content from personal notes to the web. I personally like having more control over how the material is displayed and laid out. Working directly in the native medium of the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – gives me fine-grained control. It allows me to play with typography, illustrations, graphic design, videos, animations, and interactive elements that pure text pipelines can't support. Text isn't the only way to represent ideas.
