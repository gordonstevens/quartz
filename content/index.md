Hey. These are my notes, written from my perspective.

To give a bit of background, I have over 8000 bookmarks, and at some point I was deciding that there must be a better way to do this, so I am starting to make notes, as to why these were bookmarked in the first place! 

Please view this on a desktop/laptop, because the mobile version produced by the publishing software isn't 100% with the mobile version in displaying the table of contents. I'll getting around to changing this because it is a hacky fix, but I figure I'm going to work on content firstly. 

Enjoy!
